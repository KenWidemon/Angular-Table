# TableApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You can also add the `--open` flag to automatically open your default browser to the mentioned url.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

I don't have any unit tests created for this project. Test Driven Development isn't currently a process that my team uses (even though we definitely benefit from it), and so I haven't looked too far into unit testing with Angular.

## Note

I managed to get everything done that was listed in the "High Level Specifications" section, and my code is well-commented to avoid confusion. If you are using a different dataset, it will need to be formatted the same as `app/common/constants/mock-data.constant.ts`. I edited the original dataset from JSON format to an array constant.
